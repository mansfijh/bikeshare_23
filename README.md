# Bike Share 23
## Joshua Alessio, Kashyap Vallur and Marco Camalich
### Problem Statement
Washington DC's public bikeshare dataset is a classic data science project. Much can be gleaned from this data. In this report, we set out to determine if any of the bike stations were particularly efficient or inefficient in 2023. We will analyze how much each station is used, and draw conclusions about how to optimally position the bicycle infrastructure in order to maximize ridership.
